ChangeLog
=========

v2.4 Added Layout and Block classes (imported from the "Beamer" project).  These are for subdividing the screen to allow different things to be shown in different regions, but with each thinking that it is running in the fullscreen.

v2.2a Added and developed Bezier class and bezier shader.
      (The a is because of a network failure on first update.)

v2.1 Updated to latest version of cmodule.  Cleaned up Main

v2.0 Split into separate projects: "Library Graphics" is a suite of
     mainly graphical functions.

v1.0 Converted to use toadkick's cmodule for importing 
     and Briarfox's AutoGist for versionning.
     It needs toadkick's code from 
        https://gist.github.com/apendley/5411561
     tested with version 0.0.8
     To use without AutoGist, comment out the lines in setup.
